# AI_Project
This is my AI final project, which I did with my teammate, [Sina Zamani](https://github.com/sinazamani9364).

In this project we had to implement an intelligent agent for the Bipedal Walker game, hence we performed it in 2 approaches:
* QLearning
* approximate QLearning



###### Each of them has its own branch
